# Miscarriage Prediction Project

This project focuses on predicting miscarriage using machine learning techniques. The notebook includes data preprocessing, outlier detection, feature engineering, and model evaluation using Random Forest and Feedforward Neural Network algorithms.

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop predictive models for miscarriage risk based on various health parameters. The notebook demonstrates:

1. Data preprocessing and outlier detection
2. Feature engineering
3. Model training and evaluation (Random Forest and Neural Network)
4. Performance metrics comparison
